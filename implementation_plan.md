# Implementation Plan - New Task

## Goal
Plan a trip from New York City to London using sustainable transport methods, minimizing carbon emissions while maintaining practicality, cost awareness, and traveler comfort.

## Proposed Changes
- [ ] Define sustainability criteria and constraints (e.g., CO₂ emissions per passenger-km, avoidance of short-haul flights, preference for electrified or low-emission transport).
- [ ] Identify feasible transatlantic low-emission transport options, such as:
  - Passenger-capable transatlantic ships (e.g., modern cruise ships, cargo-passenger hybrids).
  - Hybrid itineraries combining rail travel within North America and Europe with ocean travel.
- [ ] Plan a detailed step-by-step itinerary including:
  - Departure point(s) in New York (rail terminal or port).
  - Overland rail travel to the departure port if required.
  - Ocean crossing route, duration, and operator.
  - Arrival port in the UK or nearby European country.
  - Rail or coach travel from arrival port to London.
- [ ] Estimate travel times for each leg and total journey duration.
- [ ] Provide approximate cost ranges for each segment.
- [ ] Compare estimated carbon emissions of the proposed plan against a standard direct flight (baseline).
- [ ] Document assumptions, data sources (e.g., emissions calculators, transport operators), and limitations.
- [ ] Present the final plan in a clear, user-friendly format (bulleted itinerary plus summary table).

## Verification
- [ ] Cross-check transport options against current real-world availability.
- [ ] Validate emissions estimates using at least one reputable calculator or dataset.
- [ ] Review itinerary for logical continuity, feasibility, and clarity.
